# NLP Practicals

This git repository contains the scripts I've written as part of my Part II Units of Assessment NLP practicals.

## Part I

Please use python2 when running this code. You will also require the SVMlight package - check the Part I report for a link to it (or use `pip install svmlight`).

If testing using stemmed reviews, please create the necessary directories and run `perform_stemming.py` to generate the stemmed reviews before trying to run the other scripts with the appropriate options.
